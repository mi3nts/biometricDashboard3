## **GSR**

### Quick Summary

The galvanic skin response (GSR) refers to changes in sweat gland activity that are reflective of the intensity of our emotional state, otherwise known as emotional arousal. Our level of emotional arousal changes in response to the environment we’re in – if something is scary, threatening, joyful, or otherwise emotionally relevant, then the subsequent change in emotional response that we experience also increases eccrine sweat gland activity.

### Why do we care?

Skin conductance is not under conscious control. Instead, it is modulated autonomously by sympathetic activity which drives aspects of human behavior, as well as cognitive and emotional states. Skin conductance therefore offers direct insights into autonomous emotional regulation. It can be used as an additional source of insight to validate self-reports, surveys, or interviews of participants within a study.

### How do you measure GSR?

The amount of sweat glands varies across the human body, but is the highest in hand and foot regions (200–600 sweat glands per cm2), where the GSR signal is typically collected from. Skin conductance is captured using skin electrodes which are easy to apply. GSR devices typically consist of two electrodes, an amplifier (to boost signal amplitude), and a digitizer (to transfer the analog raw signal into binary data streams). Wireless GSR devices further contain data transmission modules for communication with the recording computer. Data is acquired with sampling rates between 1 – 10 Hz and is measured in units of micro-Siemens (μS). They typically range from 10 - 50 μS.
