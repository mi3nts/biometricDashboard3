## **SPO2**

### Quick Summary

Oxygen saturation is the fraction of oxygen-saturated hemoglobin relative to total hemoglobin (unsaturated + saturated) in the blood. The human body requires and regulates a very precise and specific balance of oxygen in the blood. Normal arterial blood oxygen saturation levels in humans are 95–100 percent. If the level is below 90 percent, it is considered low and called hypoxemia.

### Why do we care?

Arterial blood oxygen levels below 80 percent may compromise organ function, such as the brain and heart, and should be promptly addressed. Continued low oxygen levels may lead to respiratory or cardiac arrest. There is also a visible effect on the skin, known as cyanosis due to the blue (cyan) tint the skin takes on.

### How do you measure SPO2?

Through pulse oximeters, which function by using light sensors to record how much blood is carrying oxygen and how much blood is not. Oxygen-saturated hemoglobin is darker to the naked eye than non-oxygen saturated hemoglobin, and this phenomenon allows the highly sensitive sensors of the pulse oximeter to detect minute variations in the blood and translate that into a reading. Normal ranges are between 95–100 percent.
