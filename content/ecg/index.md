## **ECG Module**
### What does it show?
An ECG can be analyzed by studying the components of the waveform. The first initial upward tracing is the p wave, which indicates atrial contraction. The QRS complex, which begins with a small downward deflection,Q, followed by an upward deflection, which is called an R peak, and then a downward deflection S. The QRS complex indicates ventricular depolarization and contraction. Finally, the T wave, which is normally a smaller upwards waveform, representing ventricular repolarization.
