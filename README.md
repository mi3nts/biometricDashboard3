Electroencephologram (EEG) evaluates brain activity. Electrodes are placed on the scalp and measure the electrical impulses that occur in the brain and record the results. The results are in the form of wave patterns that can be evaluated at different frequency bands such as the delta band, which is usually associated with deep sleep. From these results, certain brain disorders can be detected such as seizures, brain tumors, and head injuries.

For our project, there are 64 electrode sensors placed on the subject and the data is gathered from the electrical impulses that the electrodes measure. The goal for the EEG visualization is to plot the topomaps for the delta band, theta band, alpha band, and total band, and show the electrical activity that is being picked up by the different sensors.
